    <h3> Getting the ingredients</h3>

<p>The first thing to get is of course, some rice!
Feel free to choose the rice of your choice but if you are new to
eating rice, I recommend white rice which can pair well with most dishes. </p>

 <p> Next on our list is a rice cooker. If you already have one, grea But if you don't, you should consider buying one as it is a very usefulor to to the second option which doesn't need a rice cooker but otherwise </p>

 <p> Lastly, we have purified water which should be acessable everywhere.</p>

 <h2> Getting the right amount</h2>

 <p> After getting all of our ingredients, let's start cooking our rice.
  First, remember to measure the amount of cups of rice you want to cook.
  Depending on how many people you are cooking for, put in the corresponding
  cups of rice into your rice cooker </p>

 <h2> Washing your rice </h2>
    <p> After putting your rice into your rice cooker, it's time to wash your
    rice. Washing rice is a very simple process, put some water and wash it 
    off lightly similair to washing some vegetables and then poor out the water. 
    Some people say to wash it 2-3 times while some people say to wash it until </p>
    the water runs clear but you can choose between those options. </p>

    <h2>Cooking the rice </h2>
<p> Now, close the rice cooker, and depending on your rice cooker, press the cook button 
    and wait 40-60 minutes again, depending on your rice cooker/ mode </p>

<h2> How to identify if it is good </h2>
    <p> When you open the rice cooker, remember to open it slowly and to 
     not put your face too close as the steam will instantly try to escape 
     so it is best to leave it open for 5 - 10 seconds to let it cool off. 
    after that, mix the rice with a big spoon. if you put the spoon into the rice, 
    if some of it sticks to it but is slowly falling, that's a good sign. If otherwise, 
     no rice sticks on it or a lot of rice sticks on it, that means the rice is perfectly cooked </p>
