    <li> Trends</li>
    <p> Going along with trends can be a quick and easy but good way

    <li> Occasions </li> 
    <p> Wearing clothes that don't fit the occasion can make you stand out 
        and can make you appear out of place and look unique. 
        Wearing overly formal or casual clothing to an event can make you noticed
         which can help boost your confidence and and can help you enjoy the occasion even more. </p>
